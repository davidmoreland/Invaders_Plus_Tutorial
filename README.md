This tutorial basicallly was in one main class.  I began to break out the classes as ship, bullets, etc.  I also thought it would me neat to have some settings to change.  Then I began to play around with the physics.  Not sure where this version is at the moment (May 2, 2017).  However, it is VERY ROUGH - work in progress.
